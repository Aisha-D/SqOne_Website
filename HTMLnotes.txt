## Notes for HTML

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
The <h1> element defines a large heading
The <p> element defines a paragraph


<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>
#The link's destination is specified in the href attribute. 


<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">
HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.
The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided.
The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed
There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:
1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".
Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.
2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".
Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.

The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.



<p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>
The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:


<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.


You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
...
</body>
</html>



<p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:
